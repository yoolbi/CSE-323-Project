## Target User Population

### Office Workers

## Problem
During lunchtime, office workers often run out of time because there are so many people in nearby restaurants that they have to wait, and spend a lot of time looking for restaurants with seats left.

## Existing Related Solutions

1. APP 'Serving' (서빙) 

2. App 'Catch Table' (캐치테이블)

3. Naver Reservation

They all can book restaurants. However, reservations are difficult in real-time on the same day, and it is currently impossible to check how many seats are left for each restaurant.

## Plan

- In-person Interview: Yool Bi's sister and brother (both are office workers), Restaurant workers
- Online forum: kakaotalk open chatting, instagram
